# YLERP: The Fake Stereotypical Hacker 'Code' Generator

# Your Local Extremely Random Program

Generates fake movie stereotypical 'hacker code'. Over 1 million possiblities!

# How It Works
How YLERP works is actually really simple. It's using C# 's built in random library and a bunch of arrays. I basically created a fake programming language and wrote a bunch of code that makes no sense in these *string[]* arrays. I did a bunch of variations of fake code that ultimately conveys the same idea. then i also made the variables used in *if* and *while* or *construct(standardConstruct.Make)* (which are also randomised in their own array!)

#Can you use YLERP in your own projects?
Yes

#How to use YLERP in your own projects
I have no idea.
