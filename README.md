### YLERP™: The Fake Stereotypical Hacker 'Code' Generator 

### Your Local Extremely Random Program™

### VERSION 1.1.0

### What YLERP Does
Generates fake movie stereotypical 'hacker code'. Over ***10 TRILLION*** possiblities! To be exact, ***10,279,552,640,000*** possible out comes!

### How It Works
How YLERP™ works is actually really simple. It's using C# 's built in random library and a bunch of arrays. I basically created a fake programming language and wrote a bunch of code that makes no sense in these *string[]* arrays. I did a bunch of variations of fake code that ultimately conveys the same idea. then i also made the variables(example: if *a* > *b*) used in *if* and *while* or *construct(standardConstruct.Make)* (which are also randomised in their own array, and so are the logical operators!)
After YLERP is done generating your random code, YLERP will create a text file, "CodeOutput", which will have the same code, but you can actually copy it since you can't copy the code from the console application. 

### Can you use YLERP™ in your own projects?
Yes

### How to use YLERP™ in your own projects
I have no idea. Just copy the code i guess. Or like copy the generated code from the created .txt file. Up to you.
