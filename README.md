# YLERP™: The Fake Stereotypical Hacker 'Code' Generator

# Your Local Extremely Random Program™

Generates fake movie stereotypical 'hacker code'. Over 1 million possiblities!

# How It Works
How YLERP™ works is actually really simple. It's using C# 's built in random library and a bunch of arrays. I basically created a fake programming language and wrote a bunch of code that makes no sense in these *string[]* arrays. I did a bunch of variations of fake code that ultimately conveys the same idea. then i also made the variables(example: if *a* > *b*) used in *if* and *while* or *construct(standardConstruct.Make)* (which are also randomised in their own array, and so are the logical operators!)

# Can you use YLERP™ in your own projects?
Yes

# How to use YLERP™ in your own projects
I have no idea. Just copy the code i guess
